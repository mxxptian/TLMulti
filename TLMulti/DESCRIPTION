Description: This R package supports TL-Multi. TL-Multi commonly performs PRS prediction for non-European populations by using the idea of transfer learning to enhance the learning performance of the target population (e.g., non-European population). TL-Multi was able to predict PRS by using summary statistics of the target population and the European population (informative auxiliary population) as well as individual-level data from the target population.
